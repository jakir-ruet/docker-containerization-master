## Welcome to Multi Container

The multi-container concept in Docker refers to running multiple containers together as part of a single application or system. This approach is commonly used when building microservices or applications that require multiple services to work together, such as a web server, a database, and a cache.

### Multi-Container Steps

Real-world applications often consist of different components:

- A web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache)
- An application backend (e.g., Node.js, Django)
- A database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- A message broker or cache (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ)

Each of these runs best in its own container, rather than combining everything into a single image, for modularity, scalability, and separation of concerns.
